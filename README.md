# 🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis Dashboard
# End-to-End Sales Analysis using Excel, SQL & Power BI

A visually rich and business-focused analytics project designed to analyze pizza sales performance, uncover customer purchasing patterns, and deliver actionable insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
# Purpose

The Pizza Sales Intelligence Dashboard is an end-to-end data analytics solution built to transform raw sales transactions into meaningful business insights.
By combining Excel for data preparation, SQL for analytical querying, and Power BI for visualization, this project helps stakeholders quickly understand revenue drivers, product performance, and time-based sales trends.

# 🧰 Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

📊 Power BI Desktop – Primary platform for building interactive dashboards

🧮 SQL – Used for KPI calculations, aggregations, trend analysis, and ranking logic

📂 Microsoft Excel – Data cleaning, validation, and initial data exploration

🧠 DAX – Calculated measures and KPI logic in Power BI

🧱 Data Modeling – Fact-based sales model enabling accurate filtering and cross-analysis

📁 File Formats – .csv (dataset), .sql (queries), .pbix (dashboard), .png (previews)

#  Business Problem

In food retail businesses, decision-makers often lack a single consolidated view to answer critical questions such as:

Which products generate the highest revenue and demand?

When do customers place the maximum number of orders?

Which pizza sizes and categories drive overall sales?

Which items should be promoted, optimized, or discontinued?

Answering these questions directly from raw data is time-consuming and error-prone.

The primary goal of this dashboard is to:

Deliver a clear, interactive overview of sales performance

Identify best-selling and underperforming pizzas

Analyze customer demand across ** days, months, and seasons

Support data-driven decisions related to pricing, inventory, and promotions
